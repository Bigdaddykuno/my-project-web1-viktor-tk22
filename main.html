      <h3>World Cup: Chaotic scenes in Buenos Aires after celebrations
        </h3>
      <h4>
        There's no denying Argentina desperately wanted to bring the World Cup trophy back home. The strength of feeling after every match during the tournament was testament to that, the dedication of fans to celebrate every goal scored.

        The pride of Argentinians is multi-layered. Yes, it's their third World Cup win and that's an achievement in itself, but it was more personal than that - in Lionel Messi they have a footballing star now rivalling their God-like Diego Maradona. How dare he not take home the only trophy he was missing - they wanted it for Leo.
        
        But this is a country that also needed some uplifting - a chance to dream, to smile, to have some fun. Argentina has been facing an endless economic crisis and with soaring inflation, every day gets harder. The tournament was a chance to switch off and kick back - and wow, did they do that.
        
        "We have suffered so much through these past years," one Argentinian told me. "It's the first time we have something to celebrate."
        
        Sunday's celebrations were immense - a spontaneous party in the centre of Buenos Aires, replicated across the country. But Tuesday's celebrations overshadowed them by a long way. It was, says the country's media, the biggest party in the nation's history.
        
        "Today the people don't care whether they eat or not," said another reveller. "If people are happy and joyous, the money doesn't matter. People are happy to spend it today."
