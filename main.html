      <h3>Drugs: India police say rats ate 200kg of seized cannabis</h3>
      <h4>
        Police in India have blamed rats for destroying nearly 200kg (440lb) of
        cannabis seized from dealers and kept in police stations. "Rats are tiny
        animals and they have no fear of the police. It's difficult to protect
        the drug from them," a court in Uttar Pradesh state has said. The court
        had asked the police to produce the stash as evidence in cases of drug
        peddling. The judge cited three cases in which marijuana was destroyed
        by rodents. Judge Sanjay Chaudhary said in an order that when the court
        asked the police to produce the seized drug as evidence, it was told
        that 195kg of cannabis had been "destroyed" by rats. In another case
        involving 386kg of the drug, the police filed a report saying "some" of
        the cannabis was "eaten up by the rats". Judge Chaudhary said some 700kg
        of marijuana seized by the police was lying in police stations in
        Mathura district and that "all of it was under danger of infestation by
        rats".
